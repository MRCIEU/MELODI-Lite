      Previously we created MELODI, a method and tool to derive overlapping enriched literature elements connecting two biomedical terms, e.g. an exposure and a disease, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyx251" target="_blank">(Elsworth et al., 2018)</a>. 
      The main data involved were derived from SemMedDB <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/28/23/3158/195282" target="_blank">(Kilicoglu et al., 2012)</a>, in particular a set of annotated ‘subject-predicate-object’ triples created from the titles and abstracts of almost 30 million biomedical articles. 
      <br><br>
      Here, we present MELODI Presto. A quicker and more agile method to identify overlapping elements between any number of exposures and outcomes. The modifications made to the data, architecture and method are listed here <a href="https://github.com/MRCIEU/MELODI-Presto" target="_blank">https://github.com/MRCIEU/MELODI-Presto</a>.
